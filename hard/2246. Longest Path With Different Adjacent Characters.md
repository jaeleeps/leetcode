# Description

You are given a **tree** (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) **rooted** at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a **0-indexed** array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return *the length of the **longest path** in the tree such that no pair of **adjacent** nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.*

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/testingdrawio.png)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "abacbe"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. 
</pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/graph2drawio.png)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> parent = [-1,0,0,0], s = "aabc"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `n == parent.length == s.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
* `parent[0] == -1`
* `parent` represents a valid tree.
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### MINE

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

class Solution:
    def longestPath(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> int:
        n = len(parent)
        E = defaultdict(list)
        ans = 1
        candidates = set()

        for u, v in enumerate(parent):
            if v < 0:
                continue
            if s[u] != s[v]:
                candidates.add(u)
                candidates.add(v)
                E[u].append(v)
                E[v].append(u)

        def dfs(u: int):
            visited.add(u)
            len_heap = []
            max_inc_1 = max_inc_2 = max_exc = 0
            for v in E[u]:
                if v not in visited:
                    inc, exc = dfs(v)
                    if inc > max_inc_1:
                        max_inc_2 = max_inc_1
                        max_inc_1 = inc
                    elif inc > max_inc_2:
                        max_inc_2 = inc
                    max_exc = max(exc, max_exc)
            return 1 + max_inc_1, max(max_inc_1 + 1 + max_inc_2, max_exc)


        visited = set()
        for c in candidates:
            if c not in visited:
                inc, exc = dfs(c)
                ans = max(ans, inc, exc)

        return ans

# Description

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

Return *an array of size `n`* where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `i<sup>th</sup>` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/q3e1.jpg)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).
</pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/q3e2.jpg)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = "bbbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,2,1,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.
The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.
</pre>

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/q3e3.jpg)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = "aabab"
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,2,1,1,1]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* `labels.length == n`
* `labels` is consisting of only of lowercase English letters.

### MINE

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countSubTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], labels: str) -> List[int]:
        E = defaultdict(list)
        visited = set()
        ans = [0] * n

        for u,v in edges:
            E[u].append(v)
            E[v].append(u)

        def dfs(u):
            visited.add(u)
            curr_counter = defaultdict(int)
            curr_counter[labels[u]] += 1
            for v in E[u]:
                if v not in visited:
                    counter = dfs(v)
                    for key in counter:
                        curr_counter[key] += counter[key]
            ans[u] = curr_counter[labels[u]]
            return curr_counter
        
        dfs(0)
        return ans

```
